# GSC_Sustainability

The GSC Sustainability Website serves as a platform wholly controlled by GSC Sustain to:

1) introduce us to interested folks
2) store links to useful links and websites, including but not limited to our Instagram, mailing list, Slack channel, the Sustainability Fund, and Sustainability Student Coalition (SSC).
3) document our activities (alongside Instagram)

## Instructions for editing the website

As you can see from the [website](https://gsc-sustainability.github.io), the entire website is contained on one page, and headers at the top of the page direct to different sections on the page. Therefore, you can copy-paste from existing code and use copilot for the rest :smile:

- `assets` mostly contain website backend code. No need to use these files unless you know how to read and edit it
- `image` contains image files
- Contents are written in `index.html` and formatting is controlled in `main.css`


## To-do

- Change the background to wholly white

Say hello to Stellar, a slick little one-pager with a super vibrant color palette (which
I guess you can always tone down if it's a little too vibrant for you), a "sticky" in-page
nav bar (powered by my Scrollex plugin), a separate generic page template (just in case
you need one), and an assortment of pre-styled elements.
